In this project,

assume the role of a data scientist tasked with assisting a US-based housing company, Surprise Housing,

as it embarks on expanding into the Australian real estate market. Your primary objective is to develop a machine learning model

that accurately predicts the actual value of potential properties, enabling the company to make informed investment choices.

Project Objective: Create a robust machine learning model capable of forecasting house prices in the Australian real estate market.

This predictive tool will serve as a vital asset for Surprise Housing, aiding them in identifying prospective properties

for acquisition. Furthermore, it aims to unveil the significance of variables that influence house prices and

how these variables collectively describe the price of a house.
